Resources to create acoustic models and TextGrids with word- and phone alignments and to extract phonetic measures, derived from the Common Voice Corpus

## Common Voice Processing Instructions**

**Prep files and generate lexicon, acoustic model, forced alignment**

1.	Download language from Common Voice

**Prep wav files and TextGrids**

2.	Get speaker IDs to put on TextGrids for speaker adaptation

Run remap_spkrs.py

python3 ~/Desktop/remap_spkrs.py /Users/eleanor/Documents/CommonVoice/languages/indonesian/validated.tsv /Users/eleanor/Documents/CommonVoice/languages/indonesian/validated_spkr.tsv

3.	Create validated folder

4.	Create TextGrids based on transcript + wav files for ease of use

Run processCommonVoice_v2.praat or createTextGridsWav.praat

Technically, we do not need to create wav files (MFA can handle mp3), but MFA does require that the TextGrid and audio have the same filename. MFA requires that speaker information is either the tier name or in the prefix of the filename. If itâ€™s the prefix of the filename, this must be specified in the MFA command. For the purposes of the class, it was easiest to just have them run the createTextGridsWav.praat script which generated only the validated files and ensured that the TextGrid and audio file had the same name. 

Or, just generate TextGrids with speaker ID in the tier name, and only based on validated files, then run the following to move the corresponding wav files into the same folder and in the shell, run: 

cut -f2 validated.tsv | tail -n +2 > mp3_paths.tsv
for file in $(<list.txt); do cp "$file" new_folder; done
for file in $(<mp3_paths.tsv); do cp clips/"$file" validated/; done

**Prep lexicon**

5.	Extract transcripts from validated.tsv and get each word on its own line

In the shell, run:
cat validated.tsv | cut  -f3 | sed '1d' | tr "[\,\.]" " " | tr " " "\n" | sed 's/^[[:punct:]]*//' | sed 's/[[:punct:]]*$//' |  tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort | uniq > indonesian.txt

6.	Run epitran or submit to XPF

python3 run_epitran.py indonesian.txt indonesian_lexicon.txt ind-Latn

7.	If XPF, create custom Python script to separate phones with spaces
See for example:
python3 ukrainian.py xpf_output_ukrainian.txt

**Run Montreal Forced Aligner**

8.	Activate the aligner

conda activate aligner

9.	Put lexicon in Documents/MFA/pretrained_models/dictionary/

10.	Validate corpus

mfa validate ~/Documents/CommonVoice/languages/indonesian/validated indonesian_lexicon  --ignore_acoustics --clean

11.	Train acoustic model using corpus 

mfa train --clean ~/Documents/CommonVoice/languages/indonesian/validated indonesian_lexicon ~/Documents/CommonVoice/languages/indonesian/indonesian_cv10

12.	Put new acoustic model in Documents/MFA/pretrained_models/acoustic/ if not there already

13.	Align corpus using new acoustic model

mfa align ~/Documents/CommonVoice/languages/indonesian/validated indonesian_lexicon indonesian_cv10 ~/Documents/CommonVoice/languages/indonesian/output/
